The Repo will be updated eveyday as I explore new things. 

💡 What’s inside:
- Topic-wise folders (Basics and Fundamentals, Arrays, Strings, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Trees, Graphs, DP, etc.)
-  Each Folder includes:
-  Topic wise short description
  - Short problem statement
  - Example input/output
  - Simple approach explanation
  - Time & Space complexity
  - Java solution code
-  Learn-by-doing structure — build your understanding step-by-step.
